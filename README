gnome-u2ps - Unicode text to PostScript

  Gnome u2ps is a Unicode(UTF-8) text converter to a2ps style PostScript.

  U2ps provides a modern, code-reusable replacement of a2ps.

WHY
---

- To let GNOME power to CUI
- English speakers are satisfied with a2ps, but non-English not
- To avoid to hack horrible codes in a2ps
